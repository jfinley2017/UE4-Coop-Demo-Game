- Scoreboard, settings menu, damage numbers, kill feed, etc.

This is a collaboration between myself and Joe Finley (https://github.com/jfinley2017)

While we put some thought towards aesthetics, our biggest concern was how the game feels to play, and generally making a workable multiplayer game in UE4.

It's open-source (MIT) so feel free to grab useful bits of code or whatever
