This is a collaboration between myself and Joe Finley (https://github.com/jfinley2017)

While we put some thought towards aesthetics, our biggest concern was how the game feels to play, and generally making a workable multiplayer game in UE4.

It's open-source (MIT) so feel free to grab useful bits of code or whatever

We used Git for a while, then Plastic SCM, then Perforce. So..now we have a bit of experience with everything I guess.

Can't guarantee the game will build right away if you decide to download it, but I encourage you to try. There's a built version in the releases tab, but it requires you to already have UE4 installed on your computer for it to work (4.20).
